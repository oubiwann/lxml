# Introduction

*An LFE XML Library*

<img src="images/professor-xavier-emile.png" />

lxml is an LFE library which wraps <a href="https://github.com/willemdj/erlsom">erlsom</a>'s XML-parsing capabilities and adds
an API for easily accessing the parsed data.

Note that this library has not wrapped all of erlsom; only <code>erlsom:simple_form</code>.
